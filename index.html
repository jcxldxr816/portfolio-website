        <h2>More About Me</h2>
        <p>I've worked in many different languages over the years and I'm always eager to learn! I've worked with Python, C#, C++, Java, Javascript, and Swift. Currently, I'm learning how to build websites/apps in React, to further expand my toolkit.</p>
        <p>In my free time, I like to play and make games. I've played around with different game concepts in Unity, as well as Godot. In the future, I hope to make a full game entirely on my own, and publish it on Steam.</p>
        <p>I'm familiar with both Windows and Mac, and I'm comfortable doing many things in Linux. I also have experience with Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator.</p>
